# The-Pintsmen: Our Scrabble Board Game

### Grid Reference / Gameplay

Our Grid Is From:

A - O -> Columns

1 - 15 -> Rows

The middle of the board is H8. This is where the 
first move will take place.

### An Example First Move
H8 A PROJECT

This will place the word "PROJECT" in the centre of 
the board going across.

### Challenges

Challenge the previous player by typing and submitting "CHALLENGE".
This will check if the player's word was in the dictionary or
not.

A valid challenge will remove the word, decrease the 
other players score, and allow you to continue your move.

An invalid challenge will sacrifice your move!
